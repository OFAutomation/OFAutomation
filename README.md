** Welcome to OFAutomation !

-------------
Introduction
-------------
OFAutomation is a solution that aims to interact with and automate all 
components in the OpenFlow/SDN network.

OFAutomation is a end to end automation solution for automating tests 
run across various components in an OpenFlow topology. This solution 
aims to provide an automation framework, that is not just exhaustive in
coverage, but also makes it easy to debug and author scripts. 
It allows for authoring scripts in plain English and can be run standalone
from the command line.
